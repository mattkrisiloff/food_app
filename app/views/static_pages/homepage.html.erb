<h1>Welcome to Food@3301!</h1>

<h4>We've made this website to help us gauge exactly how many people would like food. We're cooking a meal tonight, and if you're around, a meal tomorrow for Thanksgiving. Let us know if you're interested!</h4>

<%@meals.each do |meal, i| %>
	<%if meal.date.day == Time.now.day%>
		<h2>Today: <%= meal.title%></h2>
	<%else%>
		<h2>Tomorrow (Thanksgiving): <%= meal.title%></h2>
	<%end%>
	<h3><%= meal.description%></h3>
	<h3>Number of meals available: <%=meal.slots%></h3>
	<%= form_tag charges_path do %>
		<article>
			<label class ="amount">
				<span>Cost: <%= number_to_currency(meal.price) %></span>
			</label>
